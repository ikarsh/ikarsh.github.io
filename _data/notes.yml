  comments: >
    A huge set of notes on class field theory, optimized for containing all the nitty-gritty details.
    The first half (group cohomology & local class field theory) is polished;
    the second half (Brauer groups, global class field theory) is more drafty.
    Includes a proof of Chebotarev density theorem.
- title: "Local Fields"
  url: "/assets/papers/local-fields.pdf"
  comments: >
    Notes about ramification and tame ramification in local fields,
    leading to the structure of the absolute Galois group of a local field.
- title: "Homotopic Topology"
  url: "/assets/papers/homotopic-topology.pdf"
  comments: >
    Notes on algebraic topology: spectral sequences, obstruction theory,
    cohomology operations, the Adams spectral sequence, and K-theory.
    Based mostly on Fomenko and Fuchs, with other sources to fill in proofs.
