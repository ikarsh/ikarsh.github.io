    This is a huge set of notes on class field theory.
    It is optimized for containing all the nitty-gritty details.
    The first half (group cohomology & local class field theory) is
    really polished and the second half (Brauer groups, global class field theory) is more drafty.
    There is also a proof of Chebotarev density theorem.

    These are notes about topics in algebraic topology:
    proving the main theorems with spectral sequences, 
    obstruction theory,
    cohomology operations, the adams spetral sequence, and K-theory.
    The sections on K-theory and on the Adams spectral sequence are more rough.
    The notes are based mostly on the book "Homotopic Topology" by Fomenko and Fuchs,
    but I used many other sources to fill in proofs
    and to structure things in a way that made sense to me.

    A writeup of the proof of GAGA.
    Meant to contain all the relevant background.
