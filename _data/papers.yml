    This is a huge set of notes on class field theory.
    It is optimized for containing all the nitty-gritty details.
    The first half (group cohomology & local class field theory) is
    really polished and the second half (Brauer groups, global class field theory) is more drafty.
    There is also a proof of Chebotarev density theorem.
