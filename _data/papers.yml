    This is a really huge set of notes on class field theory,
    amalgamated from various different notes I wrote.
    It is mostly optimized for containing all the details of the proofs.
    The first half (group cohomology & local class field theory) is
    really polished and the second half (Brauer groups, global class field theory) is more drafty.
    There is also a proof of Chebotarev density theorem.
